# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](https://github.com/leec313/Fetch-and-Feast/blob/main/README.md) file.

## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate all of my HTML files. I have used validate by URI in as many cases as possible shown below. Any areas not accessible by W3C - I used direct input via the rendered source code.

## Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to validate all of my Python files. Along the way I have made sure my code was clean by using the Pep8 and Flake8 addons within GitPod.
